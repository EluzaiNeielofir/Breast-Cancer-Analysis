# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
**Objective:** To perform EDA, PCA and ML Predictive Modeling and Data visualization on finding Malignant and Benign tumors.

**Analysis :**
• Performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) which takes all labels in consideration, measures of the central trend,
check for absence of values and worked with categorical variables.

• Got the data ready to check the target distribution and feature distribution to get a visual idea on what the data is
about and used correlation matrix for variables in Heat map and checked the correlation between few features by pair
with Positive correlated features and Uncorrelated features with scatter plots.

• Later to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) I normalized the data and conducted 3 pie plots with 6,2, and
3 components and to get the metrics i.e. Accuracy, Precision and Recall I performed Confusion matrix to measure the
performance of the model.

• Did a Train and Test split and performed predictive modeling with ML algorithms like Logistic Regression and
GridSearch CV to optimize accuracy and use Ensemble Classifier to maximize precision to detect all malignant
tumors.

**Result :** Successfully detected all malignant to benign tumors helping the client find and classify patients tumors with means of
various parameters using ML algorithms in detecting all the malignant tumors with 98% accuracy, 99% precision and 96%
recall.
